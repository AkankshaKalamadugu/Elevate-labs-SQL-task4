# SQL Developer Internship – Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to practice **aggregate functions** and **grouping** in SQL to summarize and analyze tabular data.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench
- Sample data table created for testing

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- `GROUP BY` clause
- `HAVING` clause
- Filtering groups
- Rounding results with `ROUND()`

## 📁 Task Description
We created and populated a table named `Employees` and performed the following operations:

### ✅ Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ->     EmpID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     Name TEXT NOT NULL,
    ->     Department TEXT NOT NULL,
    ->     Salary INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ->     Age INTEGER
    -> );
